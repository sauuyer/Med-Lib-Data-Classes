Class slides and supplemental materials for research data oriented classes at Yale University's Cushing/Whitney Medical Library

Check to see if any of these classes will be taught at the library soon at: https://library.medicine.yale.edu/classes
Route any questions about these materials to medicaldata@yale.edu. 

Repo organization: Each folder in this repo contains the available materials for one specific information session Class materials currently available in this repo include:

### 1. Research Data Documentation: Codebooks, Data Dictionaries and Readme Files

Session Objectives:
   * Describe research documentation as a method to add context to research data, and facilitate data management
   * Define and compare three main types of documentation from least to most complex: ReadMe files, data dictionaries, codebooks (with examples)
   * Showcase an example of a data download from ICPSR demonstrating how a data directory might be organized, and how documentation might look in situ 

### 2. Introduction to R

 This lecture and demonstration will overview R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The lecture will describe R, point out sources of help, and provide recommended tutorials. Participants are encouraged follow along with the demonstration.

  The demonstration will provide examples of the following R basics:
  * Math operations
  * Comparison operators
  * Conditional logic
  * For loops
  * Data structures in R

### 3. Introduction to Research Data Management - a.k.a. Research Data Management for the Health Sciences

These slides...
   * Define research data and research data management (RDM)
   * Highlight the importance of RDM
   * Identify best practices, strategies, and software for data management
   * Identify research data support providers at Yale

### 4. Working with Data
Attend this session (or flip through these presentaiton slides) if you are new to integrating data into your current  research workflows. The slides will guide you through the "research data lifecycle" (see slide 3 of this presentation), which includes the collection, finding, organizing, wrangling analysis, documentation, and sharing of reserch data. 

This class is a good primer for 5. Unix Shell: Working with Data, through this is not a required prerequisit. 
  
### 5. Unix Shell: Working with Data
This session, which is made up of a brief presentation followed by a longer hands-on demonstration in the Unix Shell. We will overview and demonstrate how you can work and manipulate data files using a command line interface. 

This workshop may be useful to you if you work with a large number of related spreadsheets or files, or if you have an interest in learning more about how your computer functions behind its graphical user interface (GUI).
